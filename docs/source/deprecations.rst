Deprecation timeline
====================

From 0.15 to 1.0.0
==================

(September 2017)

Form Presets
------------

.. deprecated:: 1.0.0

    Form presets will be deprecated in favor of Field validation rules. If needed, you'll have to convert your existing Presets to Field validations, because Presets data will be destroyed using a table deletion.

Django Rest Framework version
-----------------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.0.0

    DRF 3.3 support will be deprecated. We recommend to use the latest to date (3.6.4).
